# Quine McCluskey App Calculator

- I created this app when I first learned the concept of [Quine McCluskey algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm) in my university and wanted to apply the concept to a real app.
- The input of this app is a Boolean function in _N_ variables which evaluates to 1 on the values _n_, _n+1_, _n+2_ to _N_ (These are called minterms)
- It also accept _dont care_ variables which evaluate to _x_ in truth table
